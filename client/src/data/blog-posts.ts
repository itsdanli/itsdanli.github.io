## “This Is Water”: Choosing Awareness in the Everyday

When I first encountered David Foster Wallace’s “[This Is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCbGM4mqEVw),” it didn’t feel like a graduation speech — it felt like a wake-up call. I teared up listening to it because it struck something real — some quiet corner of myself that had gone unnoticed. Recently, I revisited it again, as I often do, to remind myself of its simple but radical message.

In a world that runs almost entirely on mental autopilot, Wallace offered something quietly revolutionary: the idea that the true value of education isn’t about being smarter or achieving more. It’s about learning **how to think**, and doing it consciously, deliberately, and with compassion.

## The Default Setting Problem

Wallace begins with a deceptively simple parable:

> Two young fish are swimming along when an older fish passes by and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?”
>
> The two young fish swim on for a bit, and then one turns to the other and says, “What the hell is water?”

That small exchange captures everything. The “water” is the invisible structure of our daily lives — the routines, the assumptions, the tiny automatic thoughts that shape our perception. We live inside them without noticing. And that’s the danger.

Our *default setting*, Wallace says, is self-centeredness — the instinctive belief that we are the center of the universe, and that everything happening around us is somehow happening **to us**. It’s not a moral flaw; it’s just how our minds are wired. But left unchecked, it becomes an invisible prison.

## The Real Freedom

The brilliance of Wallace’s message lies in how he redefines freedom. Freedom isn’t about limitless choices or independence. It’s not the ability to do whatever you want — that’s a consumer fantasy.
**True freedom is the discipline of attention.** It’s the ability to decide what to notice, and how to interpret what you see.

Think about being stuck in traffic after a long day. The default setting whispers that everyone else is an idiot in your way. But if you can pause — if you can imagine that others are tired too, maybe rushing to someone sick, maybe carrying their own invisible burdens — the whole scene changes.
That small act of reframing turns irritation into empathy. It doesn’t make the traffic move faster, but it makes **you** freer.

> “You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t.”

That’s not just philosophy. It’s practice.

## Awareness as a Daily Grind

Wallace never romanticizes awareness. He calls it what it is: a **daily grind**, a discipline, a constant job. Awareness isn’t enlightenment you achieve once; it’s a muscle you have to keep using.

Choosing to be aware means:

* Noticing when resentment starts to loop in your mind.
* Pausing before judging someone fumbling with their wallet at the store.
* Remembering that every person you see carries a life as complex and private as your own.

It’s hard. Probably the hardest thing in the world. But that effort — that decision to stay awake — gives life its texture and meaning. Without it, we live asleep, swimming in “water” we never see.

## Why It Still Cuts Through

Years later, *This Is Water* feels even more urgent. We live in an era of weaponized distraction, where our attention is the product and the price. It’s easier than ever to exist on autopilot — to scroll, to consume, to react — without ever really noticing the moment we’re in.

Wallace’s message cuts through because it refuses cynicism. Awareness, he reminds us, is not a self-help trick; it’s a **moral choice**. It’s a way of living that resists the gravitational pull of indifference.

For me, “This Is Water” is a grounding signal — a reminder that even the dull, irritating parts of life can hold meaning if I choose to look.
The grocery line. The morning commute. The endless email thread. They can all be sacred or meaningless — depending entirely on **where I aim my attention**.

Meaning isn’t found. It’s **made**. Moment by moment. Choice by choice.
