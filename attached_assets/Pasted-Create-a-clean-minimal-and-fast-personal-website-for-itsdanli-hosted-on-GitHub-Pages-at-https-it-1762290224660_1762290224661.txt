Create a clean, minimal, and fast personal website for itsdanli hosted on GitHub Pages at https://itsdanli.github.io
. Use a modern static stack and keep the codebase simple and well-documented.

Tech & structure

Framework: Astro (preferred). Use file-based routing, Markdown/MDX for content, and built-in image optimization.

Styling: Tailwind CSS (or lightweight CSS modules) with a minimal, elegant aesthetic. Include a light/dark mode toggle.

Animations: subtle only—fade/slide in on scroll (IntersectionObserver + CSS), gentle hover lifts, animated link underline. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Sections/pages:

Home: concise intro/hero, short bio, call-to-action buttons to Projects and Blog.

Projects: grid of cards sourced from a projects.json (or .ts) data file. Each card has title, short description, tech stack tags, links (GitHub, live demo).

Blog: posts in Markdown/MDX with tags, automatic listing page, pagination, RSS feed, and per-post pages. Include sample posts.

Contact: simple contact form using a static-friendly provider (e.g., Formspree) with validation + success/error states. Also list email as a fallback.

About (optional but nice): slightly longer bio, photo, and timeline.

Global:

Header with sticky nav + mobile menu.

Footer with copyright, theme toggle, and social icons.

Social links:

GitHub: https://github.com/itsdanli

LinkedIn: <YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL>

SEO & performance:

Proper <title>, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph/Twitter cards, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt.

Accessible landmarks, color contrast, focus styles, skip-to-content link.

Lighthouse targets ≥ 95 for Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO.

Content scaffolding:

src/content/blog/*.md(x) with frontmatter: title, description, date, tags, coverImage.

src/data/projects.(json|ts) with array of project objects.

Sample content: 2–3 project entries and 2 sample blog posts.

Design language:

Plenty of whitespace, typographic scale, system/variable font stack.

One accent color; neutral grays; crisp cards with subtle shadow and rounded corners.

Nice touches:

Code syntax highlighting in blog (Shiki or Prism).

Tag pages (list posts by tag).

404 page.

Optional analytics: Plausible (no cookies).

Tooling & quality:

Prettier + ESLint configured.

README.md with clear dev, content, and deploy docs.

MIT License.

GitHub Pages deployment

Repo name: itsdanli.github.io (user site).

Add GitHub Actions workflow for Astro:

Build on push to main.

Deploy to GitHub Pages (Pages → Build from GitHub Actions).

Ensure Astro site config is https://itsdanli.github.io/.

Include instructions in the README to:

npm i

npm run dev

npm run build

npm run preview

Deliverables

Astro project with:

src/pages/index.astro (Home), projects.astro, blog/index.astro, contact.astro, about.astro (optional), 404.astro

src/content/blog/ sample posts

src/components/ (Header, Footer, ThemeToggle, PostCard, ProjectCard, Pagination, TagList)

src/data/projects.(json|ts) sample entries

public/ favicons & social share image

Subtle animation utilities (CSS classes + small IntersectionObserver helper).

Accessible contact form wired to Formspree (put a placeholder form ID and document where to change it).

SEO utilities (OG image defaults, metadata helper).

RSS feed, sitemap, robots.

GitHub Actions workflow file for Pages deployment.

Clear README.md with:

How to add a project (edit src/data/projects.*)

How to add a blog post (drop a Markdown file with frontmatter)

How to update social links (Header/Footer config)

How to set the site URL in astro.config.mjs

How to turn analytics on/off

Ensure all links to social profiles are set:

Site base URL: https://itsdanli.github.io

Design cues to emulate

Clean spacing, big readable headings, comfortable line length, minimal color palette.

Motion is tasteful and optional (respect reduced motion).

Keep bundle small; no heavy JS frameworks for basic interactions.
